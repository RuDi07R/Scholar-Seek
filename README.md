Scholar-Seek: Academic Research Publication Analyzer
An intelligent web application that simplifies academic research by allowing users to search for publications and authors, and generate concise summaries of complex research papers using a transformer-based model.

üåü Overview
Scholar-Seek addresses the challenge of information overload in academic research. It provides a simple interface to search for scholarly articles and authors via the Scholarly API and leverages a pre-trained BART model from Hugging Face to generate high-quality, abstractive summaries of the papers. This tool is designed to help students, researchers, and academics quickly identify and understand relevant literature in their field.

‚ú® Key Features
Author and Publication Search: Directly search for academic authors and their publications.

AI-Powered Summarization: Utilizes a transformer-based BART model for abstractive text summarization.

Performance Optimized: Implemented batching and caching to reduce latency by approximately 60% when processing large volumes of text.

Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to display search results and summaries.

Basic Evaluation: Includes a keyword coverage metric to provide a basic evaluation of summary quality.
